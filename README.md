# Build.lua

Just a lua script that works for me as a simple build system for my ConTeXt projects. Nothing fancy or elegant, just something that does the job withot depending on anything besides a ConTeXt distribution (`luametatex` bundles its own lua interpreter).

This is a work in progress and nowhere near a complete solution. If you want to check it out and use it, you're welcome to it, but use it at your own risk. All the variables are customized for my own projects so if you want to use it, be sure to change accordingly and understand what you are doing.
